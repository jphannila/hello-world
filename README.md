# hello-world
This is GitHub tutorial related repository. In this document
I will tell something about me as requested by the tutorial:

I'm a Finnish game developer, well actually I'm quality assurance tester.
I registered into GitHub in an attempt to learn how to code. I've actually
even learned somethings already - so yay me!
